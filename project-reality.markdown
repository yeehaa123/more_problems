# From Dream Project to Real Project


## Project: MOOC website

+ Upload Curriculum / Cv's
+ Matchmaking Job / Volunteers / Headhunters
+ Ranking the Students
+ Anne-Claire: Also rank the course itself


## Problem 1: Translate Features to Code

+ Which ones will be implemented?
+ Which one will be implemented first?

+ First make it work, then improve (add features)
+ Test-First / Behaviour Driven Design

> describe "some incredibly complicated and smart feature" do
>   xit "will change the world" do
>     skip / pending
>   end
> end

## Problem 2: How would the Code look like? 

+ Not substantially more difficult than Well-Grounded Rubyist / Sinatra Book
+ Site Logic
+ Matchmaking Algorithm

## Problem 3: CSS, etc. 

+ Simple problems still take up a lot of time

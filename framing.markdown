+ Frames are no longer a device to represent, but they bring something in and out of existence


## Foucault - Window / Mirror / Canvas

+ Gazing / Perceiving
+ Rendering Visible / Invisible
+ Role: Spectators


### Anne Friedberg - Virtual Window

+ Computer screen is *window* as well as a *frame* (from 3D to 2D)


## Lacan - Door

+ Inside - Outside (Lacan, 301) 
+ Absence - Presence 
+ Giving access - Denying access (Manuel Castells, Flow *Control*)
  + Opening Doors / Shutting them
+ Role: Actor / Subject
+ Bringing 'things' to existence, taking the out of existence
+ Door as fundamental unit ==> something that says yes / no


## Glass & Light & Electricity

+ Material - Immaterial
+ Code as material (waves, electricity)
+ Anne-Claire: *"Everything is trying to become a window, where everything is actually a door"*
+ Yeehaa: *"Technology is selling itself as a window, whereas it actually functions like a door"*
